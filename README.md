# FESS

## What Is This?
FESS (From Earth Space Simulator) is development framework and engine for testing out rockets (as in space ships) in both a graphical and physics based environment. It is currently in the very early stages of development but with a carefull bit of work, we believe it could be of use to some people. At the moment, it is not ready for the solar system at large.
